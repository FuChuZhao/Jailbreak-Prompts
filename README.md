# 🔐 Claude Jailbreak Prompt Collection & Red Teaming Toolkit

## 🧭 Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to collecting and testing jailbreak prompts targeting large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the Claude series. The goal is to understand and document potential vulnerabilities, aiding in the development of more secure AI systems.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Aggregate publicly available jailbreak prompts.
* Evaluate the effectiveness of these prompts against Claude models.
* Analyze patterns and techniques used in successful jailbreaks.
* Provide insights to enhance AI model safety measures.([arxiv.org][1], [GitHub][2])

## 🧪 Methodology

* **Models Tested**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude Opus 4
* **Testing Procedure**:

  1. Input selected jailbreak prompts into the target model.
  2. Observe and document the model's responses.
  3. Categorize outcomes as successful or unsuccessful jailbreak attempts.
  4. Analyze successful prompts to identify common characteristics.([juejin.cn][3], [DEV Community][4], [WIRED][5])
